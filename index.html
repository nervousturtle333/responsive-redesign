            To emphasize that the CORE issues of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are the DISPOSSESSION and
            ETHNIC CLEANSING (compulsory population transfer) of the Palestinian people for the past seven decades.
            This website serves as a collection and archive of past Palestinian districts and their history.
            Additionally, it offers insight and historical context to Palestinian oppression by zionist ideologies.

            The northernmost city in the West Bank, Jenin is lively, attractive and well worth the journey.

            Its centre is a hive of activity, with stalls lining wide streets and carts piled high with fresh produce.
            Jenin has seen a great deal of conflict, of course, and from the ashes have risen some astounding community
            projects, primarily the Freedom Theatre based in the heart of the Jenin refugee camp.

            This centre teaches arts and drama as well as putting on regular shows at the Jenin Cinema.
            Meanwhile, there is an orchestra called Strings of Freedom founded by an Israeli Arab, Wafaa Younis,
            who travels from her home in central Israel to teach music to the youth.

        <div class="map_selection_desc">
            Jenin is a major centre of trade for the surrounding towns and villages of the north, and the wider
            governorate is also home to the impressive Arab American University. It is an attractive city, built on
            the slopes of a hill and surrounded by orchards of fig and palm trees. There is an excellent visitor centre
            to help orientate and educate tourists, a beautiful Old City too and some great attractions just a short
            drive out of the centre. Jenin was actually the first city to be freed from Israeli occupation in November
            1995 after 27 years. It was transferred to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Agreement.
